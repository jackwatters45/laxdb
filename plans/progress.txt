# PRD Progress Log

## Session: 2026-01-16

### PRD Created
- api-001: Fix API package (HttpLayerRouter migration)
- research-001: Effect-form comparison analysis
- feature-001: Graph component for blog (client-side)
- infra-001: Effect Cloudflare Hyperdrive wrapper

### Notes
- Graph component does NOT need SSR - client-side only with dynamic import
- Cloudflare scope reduced to Hyperdrive only (not full coverage)
- OpenCode plugin task dropped (using Claude Code instead)
