=== Iteration 2 ===
Story: mll-discovery-002
Description: Analyze Wayback Machine CDX API for MLL schedules
Status: COMPLETE
Output: packages/pipeline/docs/MLL_WAYBACK_DATA_MODEL.md

Key Findings:
- CDX API: web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=majorleaguelacrosse.com/schedule*&output=json
- Coverage: 2000-2001 (minimal), 2005-2006 (good), 2007-2019 (NO CAPTURES)
- Critical gap: 2007-2019 schedules NOT archived - need alternative sources
- Best snapshots: 2006 season has 45 captures with full schedule data
- URL patterns documented: /schedule/, /schedule/league/, /schedule?team={ID}
- HTML structure mapped: Date, Time, Away Team, Home Team, Scores
- Team IDs mapped for 2006 season (10 teams)
- Alternative sources identified: Sports Reference, Wikipedia, ESPN archives
