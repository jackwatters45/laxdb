--- Session History ---

[pipeline-014] COMPLETE
Summary: Added MAX_RETRY_WAIT_MS (5 min) cap to rest-client.service.ts
Files: packages/pipeline/src/api-client/rest-client.service.ts
Gotchas: util.ts already had the cap, rest-client did not

[pipeline-006-path] COMPLETE
Summary: Use relative paths in saveJson error messages
Files: packages/pipeline/src/extract/util.ts, util.test.ts
Gotchas: Had to update test expectations to match new relative path output

[pipeline-011] COMPLETE
Summary: Already exported - verified isCriticalError, saveJson, withRateLimitRetry in extract/index.ts
Files: None (already done)
Gotchas: None

[pipeline-002-switch] COMPLETE
Summary: Already better than proposed - uses exhaustiveness check instead of default
Files: None (already done)
Gotchas: TypeScript exhaustiveness check (const _: never = error) is better than default case

[pipeline-001-jsdoc] COMPLETE
Summary: Already appropriate - extractors have minimal 1-line JSDoc
Files: None (not needed)
Gotchas: Original todo assumed excessive JSDoc that was never added

[pipeline-004] COMPLETE
Summary: Added GraphQLError to PipelineError union, simplified isCriticalError signature
Files: error.ts, graphql.service.ts, extract/util.ts
Gotchas: Re-export GraphQLError from graphql.service.ts for backwards compatibility
