Games were broadcast on NBC Sports, marking the first major network lacrosse deal in years.\n\n### MLL Merger (2020)\n\nIn December 2020, the PLL announced it had acquired the assets of the [[MLL]], ending the older league's 20-year run. Select MLL teams and all contracted players were absorbed into an expanded PLL.\n\n### Growth Era (2021-Present)\n\nPost-merger, the league has grown to eight teams and expanded its media presence with ESPN as the primary broadcast partner.\n\n## Business Model\n\n### Touring Format\n\nUnlike traditional sports leagues with home stadiums, the PLL operates a touring model:\n\n- All teams travel together to host cities\n- Weekend tournament-style events\n- Reduces travel costs and logistics\n- Brings lacrosse to new markets\n\n### Player Equity\n\nPlayers receive equity stakes in the league—a first for professional lacrosse and rare in professional sports. This aligns player and league interests.\n\n### Media Strategy\n\nThe PLL prioritizes content and social media:\n\n- Full game broadcasts on ESPN\n- Extensive social media content\n- Behind-the-scenes access\n- Player-driven storytelling\n\n## Teams\n\nThe league currently features eight franchises:\n\n| Team          | Founded |\n| ------------- | ------- |\n| Archers LC    | 2019    |\n| Atlas LC      | 2019    |\n| Cannons LC    | 2019    |\n| Chaos LC      | 2019    |\n| Chrome LC     | 2019    |\n| Redwoods LC   | 2019    |\n| Waterdogs LC  | 2020    |\n| Whipsnakes LC | 2019    |\n\n## Competition Format\n\n### Regular Season\n\nTeams play a round-robin schedule across touring weekends from June through August.\n\n### Championship Series\n\nTop teams qualify for a single-elimination playoff culminating in the PLL Championship.\n\n### All-Star Game\n\nAn annual showcase featuring the league's top talent.\n\n## Broadcasting\n\n### Television\n\n- **ESPN** — Primary broadcast partner\n- **ABC** — Select games including Championship\n- **ESPN+** — Streaming for all games\n\n### Commentary Team\n\nThe broadcast features former players including:\n\n- [[Ryan Boyle]]\n- [[Paul Carcaterra]]\n- [[Quint Kessenich]]\n\n## Challenges & Criticism\n\n### Touring Model Limitations\n\n- No true \"home\" games or local fanbases\n- Weather dependency for outdoor events\n- Player fatigue from constant travel\n\n### Revenue Questions\n\n- Limited gate revenue compared to traditional models\n- Heavy reliance on media rights\n- Sponsorship market still developing\n\n### Identity Concerns\n\nSome critics argue the league prioritizes entertainment over the sport's traditions.

Most regular season games live here\n- **ESPNU** — Select midweek and weekend games\n- **Big Ten Network** — Conference games for Maryland, Ohio State, Rutgers, Penn State, Johns Hopkins, Michigan\n- **ACC Network** — Duke, Virginia, Syracuse, Notre Dame conference games\n\n### Free & Alternative Streams\n\n- **FloSports** — Patriot League, select smaller conference matchups\n- **ESPN+** is effectively required if you want to follow the season seriously\n\n### Key Broadcast Dates\n\n| Date | Event |\n| --- | --- |\n| February | Season openers |\n| March–April | Conference play heats up |\n| Late April | Conference tournaments |\n| May 10–11 | NCAA First Round |\n| May 17–18 | NCAA Quarterfinals |\n| May 24–26 | NCAA Championship Weekend |\n\n*Check NCAA.com and ESPN for exact dates and broadcast assignments.*\n\n## Men's Division I Preview\n\n### Teams to Watch\n\n**Virginia** — The Cavaliers remain the standard. Deep roster, elite coaching under Lars Tiffany, and a program that reloads rather than rebuilds. Perennial title contender.\n\n**Duke** — Always in the conversation. Duke's combination of recruiting power and offensive firepower makes them dangerous in any bracket.\n\n**Maryland** — The Terps bring Big Ten physicality and are perpetually in the title hunt. John Tillman's program hasn't missed the tournament in over a decade.\n\n**Syracuse** — The Orange have been knocking on the door. A loaded attack and the weight of a legendary program behind them.\n\n**Notre Dame** — Kevin Corrigan's squad is always well-coached and capable of a deep run. Don't sleep on the Irish.\n\n**Georgetown** — Consistently competitive and always a tough out in the Big East.\n\n**Penn State** — Rising program. Jeff Tambroni has built something real in Happy Valley.\n\n### Conference Breakdown\n\n**Big Ten** — The deepest conference in the sport. Maryland, Johns Hopkins, Ohio State, Rutgers, Penn State, and Michigan all compete at a high level. Every game is a battle.\n\n**ACC** — Star power and tradition. Virginia, Duke, Syracuse, and Notre Dame make this conference appointment viewing.\n\n**Big East** — Georgetown leads, but the conference is competitive top to bottom. Denver and Villanova are factors.\n\n**Ivy League** — Don't underestimate the Ivies. Yale, Cornell, and Princeton regularly produce tournament teams with some of the smartest lacrosse you'll see.\n\n**Patriot League** — Loyola Maryland and Army are the perennial powers, but the league sends legitimate contenders to the NCAA Tournament.\n\n## Women's Division I Preview\n\n### Teams to Watch\n\n**Boston College** — Acme Bowen has built a juggernaut. The Eagles have been dominant and are the team to beat again.\n\n**Northwestern** — Kelly Amonte Hiller's program is always elite. The Wildcats reload every year with top-tier talent.\n\n**North Carolina** — The Tar Heels are a force. Jenny Levy's squad combines speed, skill, and competitive fire.\n\n**Syracuse** — Kayla Treanor is building something special. The Orange are ascending fast.\n\n**Maryland** — The Terps are always in the mix. Too much talent and tradition to count out.\n\n### Conference Landscape\n\nThe ACC and Big Ten dominate women's lacrosse much like the men's side. The draw rule changes and shot clock have made the women's game faster and more exciting than ever.\n\n## What Makes College Lacrosse Special\n\nIf you're coming from the [[PLL]] or [[NLL]], college lacrosse hits different:\n\n- **Atmosphere** — Nothing beats a packed college stadium on a spring afternoon. Homecomings, rivalries, student sections\n- **Parity** — Upsets happen constantly. Any team can beat any team on a given day\n- **Emotion** — Seniors playing their last game. Underdogs making a run. The stakes feel real because they are\n- **Style diversity** — Every program plays differently. Virginia's methodical possession game vs Syracuse's up-tempo chaos vs a Patriot League team grinding it out\n- **The Tournament** — Single elimination. One and done. The NCAA Tournament is the best event in lacrosse, full stop\n\n## Key Resources\n\n### Websites\n\n- **[Inside Lacrosse](https://www.insidelacrosse.com)** — Rankings, recruiting, analysis.
