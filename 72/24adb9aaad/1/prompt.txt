Implement the following plan:

# Fix: CreateFeedbackInput type error for optional attachments

## Context

Most of the feedback backend plan is implemented (steps 1–5, 9 done). The remaining typecheck failure is in `packages/web/.../feedback.tsx`:

```
Property 'attachments' is missing in type '{ feedback: string; source: string; userId: string; userEmail: string; }' but required in type 'CreateFeedbackInput'
```

Root cause: `Schema.optionalWith(Schema.Array(AttachmentSchema), { default: () => [] })` makes `attachments` **optional in the encoded type** but **required in the decoded type** (`.Type`). Since the service method is typed as `create: (input: CreateFeedbackInput)`, callers must pass `attachments` even though the schema provides a default.

Marketing form was detached from the backend (steps 6–8 deferred) — it's a client-only stub with a TODO.

## Fix

**`packages/core/src/feedback/feedback.schema.ts`** — Change `attachments` from `Schema.optionalWith` to `Schema.optional`:

```typescript
// Before
attachments: Schema.optionalWith(Schema.Array(AttachmentSchema), {
  default: () => [],
}),

// After
attachments: Schema.optional(Schema.Array(AttachmentSchema)),
```

This makes `attachments` optional in both encoded and decoded types. The repo already handles the missing case: `attachments: input.attachments ? [...input.attachments] : []`.

No other files need changes.

## Verification

1. `bun run typecheck` — core + web pass (marketing has pre-existing unrelated errors)

If this plan can be broken down into multiple independent tasks, consider using the TeamCreate tool to create a team and parallelize the work.

alright, make a make commits for this fix and anything directly related to it
