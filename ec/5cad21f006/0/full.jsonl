Now I have enough information to provide a comprehensive analysis.\n\n## Investigation Summary: Marketing Package HMR Loop\n\nI've identified the root causes of the constant hot module reloading (HMR) loop in your marketing package. Here are my findings:\n\n### **Root Cause 1: TanStack Router Route Generation Cycle (PRIMARY)**\n\nThe **`tanstackStart()` Vite plugin** automatically regenerates `/packages/marketing/src/routeTree.gen.ts` whenever route files in `src/routes/` change. This creates a watch cycle:\n\n1. A route file changes (e.g., `__root.tsx` receives the `Link` import)\n2. TanStack Router plugin detects the change and regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts`\n3. `routeTree.gen.ts` change triggers Vite HMR\n4. HMR triggers formatters/linters which may touch route files\n5. This touches the watched files again, going back to step 1\n\n**Evidence:**\n- `/packages/marketing/.tanstack/tmp/` contains cached versions of `routeTree.gen.ts` (e.g., `f0a29aff-cbf78c61bb0fa40aebfe1e114e4c5ca8` dated 12 Feb 09:10)\n- `routeTree.gen.ts` was modified 09:12 while `__root.tsx` was modified 09:08, showing file regeneration after source changes\n- The `.gitignore` includes `.tanstack` (line 75), meaning this directory is excluded from git but the temp cache files are still being used\n\n**Timestamps:**\n- `routeTree.gen.ts`: Modified 12 Feb 09:12\n- `__root.tsx`: Modified 12 Feb 09:08 (staged with uncommitted changes adding `Link` import)\n- `.tanstack/tmp/` files: Modified 12 Feb 09:10\n\n### **Root Cause 2: Staged but Uncommitted Changes in `__root.tsx`**\n\nThe current working directory shows:\n- `packages/marketing/src/routes/__root.tsx` is **staged** but has **unstaged changes**\n- This file has been modified with a new `Link` import added\n- The diff shows the 404 NotFoundComponent was significantly redesigned\n\nThis mismatch between staged and working copy causes the watcher to see conflicting states during the HMR process.\n\n### **Root Cause 3: Missing Server Watch Configuration**\n\nYour `/packages/marketing/vite.config.ts` has **no explicit `server.watch` configuration** to:\n1. Exclude `.tanstack/` directory from watch\n2. Exclude `routeTree.gen.ts` from triggering HMR\n3. Set appropriate polling intervals for the dev server\n\n**Current Vite config:**\n```typescript\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // ... build config ...\n  plugins: [\n    contentCollections(),\n    viteTsConfigPaths({ projects: [\"./tsconfig.json\"] }),\n    alchemy(),\n    tailwindcss(),\n    tanstackStart(),  // ← This watches ALL routes/ files\n    viteReact(),\n  ],\n  // NO server.watch config here\n});\n```\n\n### **Contributing Factor: File Watching Pattern**\n\nWhen the `tanstackStart()` plugin runs:\n1. It watches the entire `src/routes/` directory\n2. It regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts` on any route file change\n3. This regenerated file is in `src/`, so it's watched by Vite's file watcher\n4. Vite's HMR sees the change and notifies the browser\n5. The browser refresh may trigger new TypeScript compilation\n6. New compilation may trigger formatters/linters\n7.

Now I have enough information to provide a comprehensive analysis.\n\n## Investigation Summary: Marketing Package HMR Loop\n\nI've identified the root causes of the constant hot module reloading (HMR) loop in your marketing package. Here are my findings:\n\n### **Root Cause 1: TanStack Router Route Generation Cycle (PRIMARY)**\n\nThe **`tanstackStart()` Vite plugin** automatically regenerates `/packages/marketing/src/routeTree.gen.ts` whenever route files in `src/routes/` change. This creates a watch cycle:\n\n1. A route file changes (e.g., `__root.tsx` receives the `Link` import)\n2. TanStack Router plugin detects the change and regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts`\n3. `routeTree.gen.ts` change triggers Vite HMR\n4. HMR triggers formatters/linters which may touch route files\n5. This touches the watched files again, going back to step 1\n\n**Evidence:**\n- `/packages/marketing/.tanstack/tmp/` contains cached versions of `routeTree.gen.ts` (e.g., `f0a29aff-cbf78c61bb0fa40aebfe1e114e4c5ca8` dated 12 Feb 09:10)\n- `routeTree.gen.ts` was modified 09:12 while `__root.tsx` was modified 09:08, showing file regeneration after source changes\n- The `.gitignore` includes `.tanstack` (line 75), meaning this directory is excluded from git but the temp cache files are still being used\n\n**Timestamps:**\n- `routeTree.gen.ts`: Modified 12 Feb 09:12\n- `__root.tsx`: Modified 12 Feb 09:08 (staged with uncommitted changes adding `Link` import)\n- `.tanstack/tmp/` files: Modified 12 Feb 09:10\n\n### **Root Cause 2: Staged but Uncommitted Changes in `__root.tsx`**\n\nThe current working directory shows:\n- `packages/marketing/src/routes/__root.tsx` is **staged** but has **unstaged changes**\n- This file has been modified with a new `Link` import added\n- The diff shows the 404 NotFoundComponent was significantly redesigned\n\nThis mismatch between staged and working copy causes the watcher to see conflicting states during the HMR process.\n\n### **Root Cause 3: Missing Server Watch Configuration**\n\nYour `/packages/marketing/vite.config.ts` has **no explicit `server.watch` configuration** to:\n1. Exclude `.tanstack/` directory from watch\n2. Exclude `routeTree.gen.ts` from triggering HMR\n3. Set appropriate polling intervals for the dev server\n\n**Current Vite config:**\n```typescript\nexport default defineConfig({\n  // ... build config ...\n  plugins: [\n    contentCollections(),\n    viteTsConfigPaths({ projects: [\"./tsconfig.json\"] }),\n    alchemy(),\n    tailwindcss(),\n    tanstackStart(),  // ← This watches ALL routes/ files\n    viteReact(),\n  ],\n  // NO server.watch config here\n});\n```\n\n### **Contributing Factor: File Watching Pattern**\n\nWhen the `tanstackStart()` plugin runs:\n1. It watches the entire `src/routes/` directory\n2. It regenerates `routeTree.gen.ts` on any route file change\n3. This regenerated file is in `src/`, so it's watched by Vite's file watcher\n4. Vite's HMR sees the change and notifies the browser\n5. The browser refresh may trigger new TypeScript compilation\n6. New compilation may trigger formatters/linters\n7. Any formatting touches the route files again\n\n### **Key Files Involved:**\n\n| File | Status | Issue |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| `/packages/marketing/vite.config.ts` | No watch config | Missing `.tanstack/` exclusion |\n| `/packages/marketing/src/routeTree.gen.ts` | Auto-generated | Regenerates on every route.tsx change |\n| `/packages/marketing/src/routes/__root.tsx` | Staged + modified | Has unstaged changes conflicting with staged state |\n| `/packages/marketing/.oxfmtrc.json` | Has ignore pattern | Correctly ignores `**/*.gen.ts` from formatting |\n| `/packages/marketing/.tanstack/tmp/` | Growing | Contains cache files from route generation |\n| `/.gitignore` (line 75) | Configured | `.tanstack` is properly ignored from git |\n\n### **Why This Loop Happens:**\n\n1.
