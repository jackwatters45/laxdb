# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

the mode toggle does not have an initial status. when we click it we can see which one is selected, but there is no ui showing for it when we first render a page.

### Prompt 2

i feel like it shouldnt be a fallback? we should actually get the proper color. also for dark mode, the color of the right column of the background with the dashed and diagonal lines should also be lighter ie the prod version. same with the backfround color. use playwriter and git to confirm.
