This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.


ARGUMENTS: alright. Let's Let's look at our buttons. I'm not very happy with how our buttons look at the moment. They just don't feel styled like they just don't feel like they match the theme, if you know what I'm saying. Also I don't know that the cursor worked for them. Maybe that's just Maybe that's just in storybook, but right now they're really basic and I want to make them a little more stylized and a little more fitting with the rest of our theme

remove any reference to a fucking purple gradient or I'm gonna lose my goddamn mind

it looks fine. For simple shit like this, you don't need to use the MCP server. I will just tell you. Just ask me and I'll tell you it looks good. Okay? The hover works now. I still don't like the way the buttons look. They're just they're boring. And they're they're very default. They're very they're not unique at all. Like let's make them a little more interesting, a little bit more unique. Don't go overboard. But I want something a little bit that's that more screams. It's related to LaxDB /frontend-design

---

okay, I I think this is better. I quite like it honestly. can we play with the border radius? I almost think no rounding would look nice. Also I'm not sure I noticed the tracking wide but I don't I don't really think I'd care for that anyway

---

can we make the border a little bit more subtle?

---

can we add like a different effect on click for the ghost button? It looks a little strange

---

okay. Better. Let's create another temporary variant for each kind of color scheme. You know, out of s two stuff.ix And it basically instead of like the clicking effect, I would like to try to a border that has like a bit of basically like a bracket around each edge. Again subtle and then in this like, when you click on it it sho,uldn't look any different. Maybe a hover effect, but not a clicking effect

ARGUMENTS: no, sorry, like it should still have an actual border as well, but just like you know, a darker or lighter, depending on the theme. Like little bracket thing. And then maybe something not just a color effect when you actually click on it. Something something interesting. also I don't give a shit about the success warning or orange stuff at the moment. Please I'm thinking this as more of one of the variants like a v all of the variants have some variants of this bracket bullshit

---

okay, that's not working at all. It's not using the right container. use puppeteer to check. also am I going fucking crazy? Where do where do you think the fucking button is? I there's no button for this. It's just you just have all the buttons in the same before

---

[Request interrupted by user]

---

that being said, let's add a variant. similar to what secondary looks like currently we can make that like a border variant and a new border variant because I think that one looks good. But so make basically a copy of what secondary looks like right now and then add a new a new border one based on my description and then revert the other ones back to how they looked before

---

okay, that looks fine, but like I said, bro, I I just don't understand why you're not listening. I want that secondary version. What the secondary looked like just before this, I want a version of that. in addition to the border one you just made

---

no, like the fucking border the border one with the bracket. And then when you hover it the non bracket part gets darker. The non bracket part of the border

---

dude, what the fuck are you doing? Add a new one, a totally different one. Like secondary was before we reverted back to the original ones. You literally made it. How are you struggling with this?

---

if you call it bordered one more time, I'm going to fucking lose my mind. Call it bracket two or some bullshit. It should have the brackets. It should look like what bracket looks like. The opacity on the brackets should be O and then when we hover over it the non-bracket section of the border should animate in to more opacity. We literally did this already. If you put another bordered, I'm going to switch to fucking open AI

---

okay better. Can we remove the clicking animation? It feels kind of tacky. So like the border, I guess, for the other other variations. Also, by default, I'd like these buttons to be a little bit I guess more condensed, like maybe a little less padding, just slightly

---

for bracket ghost the un quicked or hovered bracket opacity should be higher. That one should not change, it should be constant

---

i feel like you're fucking with me and I want it higher than point three. I don't understand what the hell is wrong with you

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically trace through the conversation:

1. User invoked /compound-engineering:frontend-design skill asking to improve button styling - buttons felt too basic, didn't match theme, cursor might not work

2. I explored the codebase:
   - Read button.tsx - Base UI button with CVA variants
   - Read globals.css - oklch color system, Helvetica Neue + Newsreader fonts, warm cream background
   - Read package.json - dependencies including motion, tailwind v4
   - Read marketing site components (hero.tsx, features.tsx, navbar.tsx, call-to-action.tsx) for design reference
   - Read button stories, button-group component
   - Read web app usage of buttons (teams.create.tsx)

3. First edit: Added cursor-pointer, duration-150, shadow depth to all variants. User said "looking a little better" but wanted more interesting colors and better ghost hover.

4. Second edit: Added purple gradient to default variant using --primary-gradient-start/end CSS vars. User was FURIOUS - "remove any reference to a fucking purple gradient"

5. Immediately reverted to solid bg-primary. User confirmed that's fine.

6. User said to look at marketing site aesthetics. I added tracking-wide and border-b-[1.5px] bottom border accent to default variant (from hero CTA pattern).

7. User liked it, asked to try no border radius and remove tracking-wide. I changed rounded-md to rounded-none and removed tracking-wide.

8. User asked for more subtle border. Changed from border-b-[1.5px] border-b-black/10 to border-b border-b-black/5.

9. User asked for different click effect on ghost button. Changed from active:translate-y-px to active:scale-[0.97].

10. User asked for a bracket variant with corner marks at each edge, with border animation. I created corners-border CSS class with background gradients for corner marks and a standalone "bracket" variant.

11. User clarified: should have actual border too, brackets should be on ALL variants, not a separate one. I moved corners-border to base class, restructured CSS with split properties for animation, added active state where brackets extend to 50%.

12. Bug: position:relative was missing from .corners-border class, causing ::before to anchor to wrong container. Fixed by adding it back.

13. User said brackets too prominent, wants always visible, more subtle, just opacity change on hover (no extending). Also wanted the border darkening on hover, not click.

14. User then said: create a NEW variant that looks like what secondary looked like before revert, PLUS a new bracket variant. I kept misunderstanding - created "bordered" variant multiple times which infuriated the user.

15. After much back and forth, landed on:
    - `bracket` - corners + light border (foreground/10), border darkens on hover (foreground/25)
    - `bracket-ghost` - corners only, border invisible at rest, fades in on hover (foreground/20)

16. User asked to remove ALL click animations from ALL variants, and make buttons slightly more condensed (less padding).

17. Removed all active:* states. Reduced padding: px-2→px-1.5, px-2.5→px-2.

18. User asked: bracket-ghost corners opacity should be higher and CONSTANT (not change on hover). I added corners-border-fixed class at 0.3 opacity.

19. User's LATEST message: furious that 0.3 is too low, wants it higher.

Current state of files:

button.tsx - has all variants with no click animations, tighter padding, rounded-none, bracket and bracket-ghost variants

globals.css - has .corners-border and .corners-border-fixed CSS classes

The immediate task: increase the corners-border-fixed opacity from 0.3 to something higher (maybe 0.5 or 0.6).

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user wants to restyle the shared Button component (`@laxdb/ui`) to feel more distinctive and aligned with the LaxDB brand aesthetic (editorial, warm, tactile depth). Specific requests include:
   - Fix missing cursor-pointer
   - Add shadow depth/tactile feel matching the marketing site's design language
   - Sharp corners (rounded-none)
   - Subtle bottom border on default variant
   - No click/active animations on any variant
   - Slightly more condensed padding
   - Two new bracket variants: `bracket` (corners + light full border, border darkens on hover) and `bracket-ghost` (corners always visible at HIGH opacity and CONSTANT/unchanging, border fades in only on hover)
   - NO purple gradients, NO tracking-wide, NO overboard changes

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - Base UI (not Radix) button primitives
   - CVA (class-variance-authority) for variant management
   - Tailwind CSS v4 with oklch color system
   - CSS pseudo-elements (::before) with background gradients for corner bracket marks
   - CSS background-image/position/size for corner mark rendering
   - Layered box-shadow patterns (inset highlight + outer shadow) from marketing site
   - The marketing site hero CTA as the north star for button styling

3. Files and Code Sections:

   - `/Users/jw/Desktop/repos/laxdb/packages/ui/src/components/ui/button.tsx`
     - The core button component being restyled

4. Errors and fixes:
   - **Purple gradient disaster**: Added bg-linear-to-b gradient using --primary-gradient-start/end vars. User was furious - completely off-brand. Immediately reverted to solid bg-primary.
   - **Missing position:relative**: When restructuring corners-border CSS, forgot to include `position: relative` on the parent class. The ::before pseudo-elements were anchoring to a common ancestor instead of individual buttons. Fixed by re-adding `.corners-border { position: relative; }`.
   - **"Bordered" variant naming**: Created a variant called "bordered" without bracket marks multiple times, despite user repeatedly asking for bracket marks. User was extremely frustrated. Eventually understood they wanted TWO bracket variants, not a "bordered" one.
   - **Click animation on bracket**: Added active:translate-y-px and bracket-extending animation on click. User explicitly said they want hover effects, NOT click effects. Removed all active states.
   - **Bracket opacity too low**: Set corners-border-fixed opacity to 0.3. User says this is way too low and wants it higher. THIS IS THE CURRENT UNRESOLVED ISSUE.

5. Problem Solving:
   - Ghost button hover was nearly invisible in light mode (bg-muted 0.97 vs background 0.96 = 1% difference). Fixed by switching to bg-accent (0.91) for a visible 5% contrast.
   - Button padding condensed by reducing px values by 0.5 across all sizes.
   - All click/active animations removed per user request.

6. All user messages:
   - "alright. Let's look at our buttons. I'm not very happy with how our buttons look at the moment. They just don't feel styled... right now they're really basic and I want to make them a little more stylized and a little more fitting with the rest of our theme"
   - "yeah, I think best example is to look at the aesthetics of the main page of the marketing site"
   - "okay, looking a little better. I think maybe the colors are another thing I'm not loving at the moment... the ghost button probably needs a hover effect otherwise it just kind of looks harder to tell it's being hovered"
   - "correction, I think it's just in light mode that the ghost button doesn't really have a hover"
   - "whoa whoa whoa we absolutely should not have a purple gradient that doesn't align with our theme at all"

   - "again, I don't want a clicking animation. I want a hover one"
   - "i don't mind that but it is far too not it needs to be way more subtle. And also I told you I want the border to be visible always. I just think maybe if the opacity changes"
   - "that being said, let's add a variant. similar to what secondary looks like currently we can make that like a border variant... make basically a copy of what secondary looks like right now and then add a new border one based on my description and then revert the other ones back to how they looked before"
   - "it looks fine. For simple shit like this, you don't need to use the MCP server. I will just tell you... They're boring... not unique at all... something that more screams LaxDB"
   - "okay, that looks fine, but like I said, bro, I just don't understand why you're not listening. I want that secondary version. What the secondary looked like just before this, I want a version of that. in addition to the border one you just made"
   - "no, like the fucking border the border one with the bracket. And then when you hover it the non bracket part gets darker. The non bracket part of the border"

   - "for bracket ghost the un quicked or hovered bracket opacity should be higher. That one should not change, it should be constant"
   - "i feel like you're fucking with me and I want it higher than point three. I don't understand what the hell is wrong with you"

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Increase the `.corners-border-fixed::before` opacity from 0.3 to a significantly higher value (user wants it clearly visible - maybe 0.5-0.6 or higher)
   - The bracket-ghost corner marks should be CONSTANT (not change on hover) at this higher opacity

8. Current Work:
   The user is asking me to increase the opacity of the corner bracket marks on the `bracket-ghost` variant. I added a `.corners-border-fixed` CSS class that sets the ::before opacity to 0.3, but the user says 0.3 is way too low. The corners need to be more prominent and should remain at a constant opacity (no change on hover). Only the border between the corners should animate in on hover.

   The relevant CSS in globals.css:
   ```css
   .corners-border:hover::before,
   .corners-border-fixed::before {
     opacity: 0.3;
   }
   ```
   This 0.3 needs to be increased significantly.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Increase `.corners-border-fixed::before` opacity to a much higher value (0.6 or even 0.8) per the user's last two messages: "I want it higher than point three" and "for bracket ghost the un quicked or hovered bracket opacity should be higher. That one should not change, it should be constant." Also ensure the corners-border-fixed hover state does NOT change opacity (it should be truly constant).

hey mate, if you're gonna update the default size, you probably need to update the rest of the sizes

---

shoot I kinda want to try adding border radius. Also, can you display the icon sizes? in the storybook stories

---

add a little bit more border radius please

---

just a little more

---

i feel like the border on secondary and outline are a little too subtle

---

at least in light mode. I think that's a good thing. Or wait, is it is there even one on secondary? I don't know.

---

[Request interrupted by user]

---

i feel like the colors for outline and secondary are too similar at the moment. Can we maybe make secondary a bolder white? Or just whatever color it is

---

hey, are you fucking with me? Why is there a rounding on the border for the brackets? That just doesn't make sense

---

okay, maybe we just need to make the background a little bit darker for light mode and lighter for dark mode?

---

okay, the secondary one on light mode still looks so fucking bad, I need you to change it

---

also the default buttons in light mode are like black. They should be a much lighter color like the background in dark mode. I don't o is am I crazy about that as well?

---

okay, primary that's way too white. Make it should be the same color I think as the dark background

---

i think similar for dark mode, the like whitish color is too dark

---

hey dude, you're driving me nuts. I need you to find an in-between for primary foreground. You can't just switch to what it was before. I need it to be an in between, right? In between the two you gave me

---

i feel like you just made it darker. I want it lighter

---

am I going nuts? That looks like literally no different

---

i'm not talking about the text for fuck's sake. I'm talking about the light mode default buttons. The black needs to be slightly dark or slightly lighter. it should be the exact same color as the dark background

---

okay, I can see that potentially I'm not loving how it looks. What's the text color for the primary button in light mode? I think it should be lighter if it is possible

---

i feel like you're fucking with me bro. Lighter with a white would probably mean a higher number. Lighter, not darker

---

why does it look like there's a border on ghost when we hover it?

---

is there a background on outline in dark mode or is that just an optical illusion?

---

okay, is there one on light mode? Like do you not understand the whole point of an outline?
