### Prompt 3

remove any reference to a fucking purple gradient or I'm gonna lose my goddamn mind

### Prompt 4

### Prompt 5

it looks fine. For simple shit like this, you don't need to use the MCP server. I will just tell you. Just ask me and I'll tell you it looks good. Okay? The hover works now. I still don't like the way the buttons look. They're just they're boring. And they're they're very default. They're very they're not unique at all. Like let's make them a little more interesting, a little bit more unique. Don't go overboard. But I want something a little bit that's that more screams. It's related to LaxDB /f...

### Prompt 6

okay, I I think this is better. I quite like it honestly. can we play with the border radius? I almost think no rounding would look nice. Also I'm not sure I noticed the tracking wide but I don't I don't really think I'd care for that anyway

### Prompt 7

can we make the border a little bit more subtle?

### Prompt 8

can we add like a different effect on click for the ghost button? It looks a little strange

### Prompt 9

okay. Better. Let's create another temporary variant for each kind of color scheme. You know, out of s two stuff.ix And it basically instead of like the clicking effect, I would like to try to a border that has like a bit of basically like a bracket around each edge. Again subtle and then in this like, when you click on it it sho,uldn't look any different. Maybe a hover effect, but not a clicking effect

### Prompt 11

okay, that's not working at all. It's not using the right container. use puppeteer to check. also am I going fucking crazy? Where do where do you think the fucking button is? I there's no button for this. It's just you just have all the buttons in the same before

### Prompt 12

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 13

that being said, let's add a variant. similar to what secondary looks like currently we can make that like a border variant and a new border variant because I think that one looks good. But so make basically a copy of what secondary looks like right now and then add a new a new border one based on my description and then revert the other ones back to how they looked before

### Prompt 14

okay, that looks fine, but like I said, bro, I I just don't understand why you're not listening. I want that secondary version. What the secondary looked like just before this, I want a version of that. in addition to the border one you just made

### Prompt 15

no, like the fucking border the border one with the bracket. And then when you hover it the non bracket part gets darker. The non bracket part of the border

### Prompt 16

dude, what the fuck are you doing? Add a new one, a totally different one. Like secondary was before we reverted back to the original ones. You literally made it. How are you struggling with this?

### Prompt 17

if you call it bordered one more time, I'm going to fucking lose my mind. Call it bracket two or some bullshit. It should have the brackets. It should look like what bracket looks like. The opacity on the brackets should be O and then when we hover over it the non-bracket section of the border should animate in to more opacity. We literally did this already. If you put another bordered, I'm going to switch to fucking open AI

### Prompt 18

okay better. Can we remove the clicking animation? It feels kind of tacky. So like the border, I guess, for the other other variations. Also, by default, I'd like these buttons to be a little bit I guess more condensed, like maybe a little less padding, just slightly

### Prompt 19

for bracket ghost the un quicked or hovered bracket opacity should be higher. That one should not change, it should be constant

### Prompt 20

i feel like you're fucking with me and I want it higher than point three. I don't understand what the hell is wrong with you

### Prompt 21

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Analysis:
Let me chronologically trace through the conversation:

1. User invoked /compound-engineering:frontend-design skill asking to improve button styling - buttons felt too basic, didn't match theme, cursor might not work

2. I explored the codebase:
   - Read button.tsx - Base UI button with CVA variants
   - Read globals.css - oklch color...

### Prompt 22

hey mate, if you're gonna update the default size, you probably need to update the rest of the sizes

### Prompt 23

shoot I kinda want to try adding border radius. Also, can you display the icon sizes? in the storybook stories

### Prompt 24

add a little bit more border radius please

### Prompt 25

just a little more

### Prompt 26

i feel like the border on secondary and outline are a little too subtle

### Prompt 27

at least in light mode. I think that's a good thing. Or wait, is it is there even one on secondary? I don't know.

### Prompt 28

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 29

i feel like the colors for outline and secondary are too similar at the moment. Can we maybe make secondary a bolder white? Or just whatever color it is

### Prompt 30

hey, are you fucking with me? Why is there a rounding on the border for the brackets? That just doesn't make sense

### Prompt 31

okay, maybe we just need to make the background a little bit darker for light mode and lighter for dark mode?

### Prompt 32

okay, the secondary one on light mode still looks so fucking bad, I need you to change it

### Prompt 33

also the default buttons in light mode are like black. They should be a much lighter color like the background in dark mode. I don't o is am I crazy about that as well?

### Prompt 34

okay, primary that's way too white. Make it should be the same color I think as the dark background

### Prompt 35

i think similar for dark mode, the like whitish color is too dark

### Prompt 36

hey dude, you're driving me nuts. I need you to find an in-between for primary foreground. You can't just switch to what it was before. I need it to be an in between, right? In between the two you gave me

### Prompt 37

i feel like you just made it darker. I want it lighter

### Prompt 38

am I going nuts? That looks like literally no different

### Prompt 39

i'm not talking about the text for fuck's sake. I'm talking about the light mode default buttons. The black needs to be slightly dark or slightly lighter. it should be the exact same color as the dark background

### Prompt 40

okay, I can see that potentially I'm not loving how it looks. What's the text color for the primary button in light mode? I think it should be lighter if it is possible

### Prompt 41

i feel like you're fucking with me bro. Lighter with a white would probably mean a higher number. Lighter, not darker

### Prompt 42

why does it look like there's a border on ghost when we hover it?

### Prompt 43

is there a background on outline in dark mode or is that just an optical illusion?

### Prompt 44

okay, is there one on light mode? Like do you not understand the whole point of an outline?
