# LLMs Documentation

This directory contains documentation files to help LLMs understand and work with specific libraries and frameworks used in the Lax DB project.

## Purpose

The `llms/` folder stores `.txt` files containing library-specific documentation, patterns, and examples that help AI assistants provide better code suggestions and follow project conventions.

## Usage

When working with specific libraries or frameworks, reference the corresponding `.txt` file to understand:

- Library-specific patterns and conventions
- Common usage examples
- Integration patterns with our tech stack
- Best practices and gotchas

## Adding New Documentation

When introducing new libraries or frameworks:

1. Create a new `.txt` file named after the library (e.g., `drizzle.txt`, `effect.txt`)
2. Include relevant documentation, examples, and project-specific patterns
3. Update this README to reference the new file
