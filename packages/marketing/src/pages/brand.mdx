Guidelines for using the LaxDB name and logo.

## Logo

The LaxDB logo is a simple circle mark. Use the dark version on light backgrounds and the light version on dark backgrounds.

## Name

"LaxDB" is one word with a capital L and capital DB. Not "Lax DB", "LAXDB", or "laxdb".

## Colors

We use a neutral palette—black, white, and grays. The brand intentionally avoids bright accent colors to keep the focus on the content.

## Usage

Feel free to use our logo and name when referencing LaxDB. Don't modify the logo or use it in ways that suggest endorsement without permission.
