LaxDB is a project to collect, preserve, and share professional lacrosse statistics.

Professional lacrosse has a rich history spanning decades, but much of this data has been scattered across league websites, archived pages, and fading memories. LaxDB exists to bring it all together.

We're building a comprehensive database covering the PLL, NLL, MLL, MSL, and WLA—player stats, game results, standings, and historical records, all in one place.

## Why we're building this

The sport deserves better. Fans, analysts, and researchers shouldn't have to dig through the Wayback Machine to find out who led the MLL in scoring in 2012. That information should be accessible, searchable, and connected.

## Open source

We believe lacrosse information should be open. The statistics themselves aren't ours to gatekeep—they belong to the sport's history. Our goal is simply to make them useful.

If you're interested in contributing, have corrections, or want to use the information for research, reach out. We're always looking for help expanding coverage and improving accuracy.
