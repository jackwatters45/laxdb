The **Premier Lacrosse League** (PLL) is the top professional outdoor lacrosse league in North America. Founded in 2018 by [[Paul Rabil]] and [[Mike Rabil]], the league launched play in 2019 and has since become the dominant force in professional field lacrosse.

## History

### Founding (2018)

The PLL was announced in October 2018 by Paul Rabil, a former MLL MVP and one of the most marketable players in lacrosse history. The league promised a new model: a touring format, equity stakes for players, and a media-first approach.

### Launch Season (2019)

The inaugural season featured six teams playing in a traveling format. Games were broadcast on NBC Sports, marking the first major network lacrosse deal in years.

### MLL Merger (2020)

In December 2020, the PLL announced it had acquired the assets of the [[MLL]], ending the older league's 20-year run. Select MLL teams and all contracted players were absorbed into an expanded PLL.

### Growth Era (2021-Present)

Post-merger, the league has grown to eight teams and expanded its media presence with ESPN as the primary broadcast partner.

## Business Model

### Touring Format

Unlike traditional sports leagues with home stadiums, the PLL operates a touring model:

- All teams travel together to host cities
- Weekend tournament-style events
- Reduces travel costs and logistics
- Brings lacrosse to new markets

### Player Equity

Players receive equity stakes in the league—a first for professional lacrosse and rare in professional sports. This aligns player and league interests.

### Media Strategy

The PLL prioritizes content and social media:

- Full game broadcasts on ESPN
- Extensive social media content
- Behind-the-scenes access
- Player-driven storytelling

The league currently features eight franchises:
