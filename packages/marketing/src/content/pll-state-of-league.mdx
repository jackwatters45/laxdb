The [[PLL]] enters 2025 with both momentum and questions. After absorbing the [[MLL]] in 2020, the league has established itself as the premier destination for professional field lacrosse in North America.

## The Business Side

The league continues its touring model, bringing games to new markets while maintaining strongholds in traditional lacrosse hotbeds. Television ratings have grown steadily, with ESPN coverage providing mainstream visibility.

## On-Field Product

The level of play has never been higher. Athletes like [[Ryan Boyle]] and [[Paul Carcaterra]] bring both skill and media savvy to the broadcast booth, elevating the viewing experience.

### What's Working

- **Broadcast Quality** — Production values rival major sports leagues
- **Player Marketing** — Individual stars are more visible than ever
- **Youth Pipeline** — Connection to grassroots lacrosse remains strong

### Areas for Growth

- Indoor/outdoor relationship with the [[NLL]]
- International expansion beyond North America
- Revenue diversification beyond media rights

## Looking Ahead

The [[PLL]] has proven the concept. Now comes the harder part: building sustainable growth while maintaining the sport's identity.
