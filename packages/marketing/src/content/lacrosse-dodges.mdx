**Dodging** is one of the fundamental offensive skills in lacrosse. A dodge is any move used by an offensive player to get past a defender while maintaining possession of the ball. Mastering dodges is essential for attackmen, midfielders, and any player who handles the ball in traffic.

## The Four Core Dodges

### 1. Split Dodge

The most fundamental and commonly used dodge in lacrosse.

**Execution:**

1. Attack the defender's top hip at speed
2. Plant your inside foot hard
3. Switch hands while changing direction
4. Accelerate past the defender

**Keys to Success:**

- Sell the initial direction with your eyes and body
- Keep the switch quick and tight to your body
- Explode out of the change of direction
- Protect your stick during the switch

**Best Used:**

- From up top or the wing
- When you have space to build speed
- Against defenders who overplay one side

### 2. Face Dodge

A quick, deceptive move requiring minimal footwork.

**Execution:**

1. Drive at the defender
2. Fake bringing your stick across your face
3. Pull the stick back while stepping past
4. Accelerate to the goal

**Keys to Success:**

- Sell the fake with your top hand
- Keep your feet moving through the dodge
- Don't telegraph by slowing down
- Works best with quick hands

**Best Used:**

- In tight spaces
- When closely guarded
- As a counter when defenders expect a split

### 3. Roll Dodge

A power move using your body as a shield.

**Execution:**

1. Drive into the defender's body
2. Seal them on your back hip
3. Roll your body around them (like a basketball post move)
4. Keep your stick protected on the outside

**Keys to Success:**

- Get low and wide for balance
- Maintain contact through the roll
- Keep two hands on your stick
- Finish with your head up

**Best Used:**

- Behind the goal (from "X")
- Against physical defenders
- When you have a size/strength advantage

### 4. Bull Dodge

A straight power move through contact.

**Execution:**

1. Lower your shoulder
2. Drive directly into the defender's chest
3. Absorb contact while maintaining speed
4. Push through to create separation

**Keys to Success:**

- Stay low with a wide base
- Protect the ball in your bottom hand
- Prepare for contact with core engaged
- Finish strong to the goal

**Best Used:**

- By larger, stronger players
- Against smaller defenders
- When you need to create space quickly

## Advanced Dodges

### Question Mark Dodge

A variation of the roll dodge that creates more separation.

**Execution:**

1. Start a roll dodge
2. Plant and push back the opposite direction
3. Creates a "?" shaped path

### Inside Roll

Rolling to the inside instead of outside—higher risk but catches defenders off guard.

### Swim Move

Borrowed from football, using your arm to swim over the defender's check.

### Rocker Dodge

A hesitation move that freezes defenders, then attacks.

## Dodging by Position

### Attackmen

- Rely heavily on roll dodges from X
- Need quick face dodges in traffic
- Often dodge to feed rather than score

### Midfielders

- Split dodges are primary weapon
- Need to dodge through traffic
- Transition dodges after gaining possession

### Faceoff Specialists

- Quick dodges immediately after wins
- Often use bull dodges through traffic

## Dodging Strategy

### Reading the Defense

Before dodging, read:

- Is the defender shading one direction?
- Is help coming from the crease?
- What's the slide package?

### Setting Up Dodges

- Use off-ball movement to create space
- Change speeds to keep defenders guessing
- Set up one dodge with another

### When NOT to Dodge

- Into a double team
- When help is already sliding
- With a tired or beaten move
- When a teammate has a better opportunity

## Training Dodges

### Individual Work

1. Wall ball with direction changes
2. Cone drills for footwork
3. Mirror drills with a partner

### Game Speed

- Practice dodges in 1v1 situations
- Add help defense to simulate game slides
- Work on finishing after dodging

### Common Mistakes

- Telegraphing the dodge
- Slowing down before contact
- Losing the ball during hand switches
- Not finishing to the goal
