The **National Lacrosse League** (NLL) is the premier professional indoor lacrosse league in North America. Playing a winter/spring schedule, the NLL features the fast-paced, physical box lacrosse variant and has operated continuously since 1987.

## Overview

Founded in 1986 as the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League, the NLL is the longest-running professional lacrosse league in North America. The league features teams across the United States and Canada playing the indoor "box" variant of lacrosse.

## Box Lacrosse vs Field Lacrosse

The NLL plays box lacrosse, which differs significantly from the outdoor field game played in the [[PLL]]:

| Aspect          | Box (NLL)                   | Field (PLL)            |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Playing Surface | Hockey rink (200' x 85')    | Field (110 x 60 yards) |
| Players         | 6 vs 6 (5 runners + goalie) | 10 vs 10               |
| Shot Clock      | 30 seconds                  | 80 seconds             |
| Physicality     | More contact allowed        | Less contact           |
| Stick Length    | Shorter sticks only         | Long poles for defense |
| Goals           | Smaller (4' x 4')           | Larger (6' x 6')       |

### Style of Play

Box lacrosse features:

- Constant action with shorter possessions
- More scoring (games often 10-15 goals per team)
- Physical play similar to hockey
- Emphasis on individual skill in tight spaces

## History

### Early Years (1987-2000)

The league struggled with franchise instability in its early years, with teams frequently moving or folding. Canadian markets provided the most stability.

### Growth Period (2000-2015)

Expansion into larger U.S. markets (Philadelphia, Colorado, San Diego) brought increased visibility and television deals.

### Modern Era (2015-Present)

The NLL has achieved relative stability with 15 franchises and consistent media coverage.

## Relationship with Outdoor Lacrosse

### Crossover Players

Many professional lacrosse players compete in both leagues:

- NLL season: December - May
- PLL season: June - September

This allows players to maximize earnings but creates challenges:

- **Fatigue** — Year-round competition
- **Injury Risk** — Different physical demands
- **Scheduling Conflicts** — Overlap at season edges

### League Relations

The [[PLL]] and NLL have had a complex relationship:

- Cooperation on player scheduling
- Competition for sponsors and attention
- Different audiences (box vs field fans)
- Occasional tension over player availability

## Broadcasting

### Television

- ESPN+ (United States)
- TSN (Canada)
- Local sports networks

### Streaming

- B/R Live (historical)
- NLL.com streaming

## Significance

The NLL holds cultural importance, particularly in Canada where box lacrosse is the dominant form of the sport. The league serves as:

- A pathway for Canadian players to go pro
- Preservation of traditional Indigenous lacrosse
- Entertainment alternative during hockey off-season
