The sport is being played at the highest level ever and yet the sport feels to have lost what made it special. Lacrosse media has become lazy and the [[PLL]] is sacrificing the character of the sport in the pursuit of better numbers.

How did we get here and can anything be done about it?

## The State of Lacrosse Media

Lacrosse media has become lazy. A few popular companies have a monopoly on the industry and have become reliant on clickbait and sensationalism to drive traffic. This has led to a decline in the quality of content and a lack of diversity in the stories being told. The companies that do good work are often overshadowed because they don't have the same resources or reach as the big players.

The [[PLL]] and [[Lacrosse Network]] have issues. [[Inside Lacrosse]]'s website is unusable on mobile.

## The Problem

The league feels directed towards 10 year olds. There's no revenue. It becomes uncool. Not enough lacrosse people are involved in the decision-making.

### What's Not Working

**The Media Landscape**

- Consolidation has reduced diversity of voices
- Quality content gets buried under clickbait
- Mobile experiences are broken

**The PLL**

- Weird relationship with the [[NLL]]
- Announced in 2018, still finding its footing
- Traveling games model has challenges

**Sixes**

- The format hasn't caught on
- Rule changes feel arbitrary
  - Faceoff modifications
  - Shot clock implementation

**Content Gaps**

- Where are the vlogs?
- Where is the behind-the-scenes content?
- The league doesn't feel like it knows its own identity

## What Actually Works

**The Commentators**
The broadcast talent is legitimately good:

- [[Ryan Boyle]]
- [[Paul Carcaterra]]
- [[Quint Kessenich]]
- [[Matt Palumb]]
- [[Dan Artesia]]

**Player Alumni Network**
This initiative is actually cool and connects generations of players.

## The Ecosystem

### Media Companies

- [[Lacrosse All Stars]]
- [[Inside Lacrosse]]
- [[East Coast Dyes]]
- [[Stringking]]

### The Leagues

- **[[PLL]]** - [[Paul Rabil]], [[Mike Rabil]]
- **[[NLL]]** - The indoor game continues
- **[[MLL]]** - Now defunct
- **[[NCAA]]** - College remains the heart of the sport
