summary: A new interactive force-directed graph lets you explore connections between players, teams, and seasons visually.

The knowledge graph is one of the things that makes LaxDB different from a spreadsheet. Every entity in our database — players, teams, seasons, games — is connected by typed relationships. The new graph explorer makes those connections browsable.

Click any node to expand its connections. Filter by relationship type. Search for a player and see every team they've played for, every teammate they've shared a roster with, and how those connections branch outward.

- Interactive force-directed layout with zoom and pan
- Color-coded nodes: players, teams, seasons, leagues
- Click-to-expand exploration pattern
- Shareable URLs for any graph state
