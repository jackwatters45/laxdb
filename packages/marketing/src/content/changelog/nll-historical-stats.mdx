This was our most ambitious data project to date. The NLL (originally the Eagle Pro Inline Hockey League, then the Major Indoor Lacrosse League) has existed in various forms since 1987, and its historical data has been scattered across defunct league websites, PDFs, and fan archives.

We've assembled, verified, and normalized stats from every season. Where official records had gaps, we cross-referenced multiple sources. The result is a continuous statistical record for every franchise, including through relocations and name changes.

- 37 seasons of player and team statistics
- Franchise history tracking through relocations (e.g. Philadelphia Wings to New York Riptide)
- Career stats spanning the full NLL/MILL/EPBLL history
- Season-by-season league leaders for major categories
