From day one, we've believed that lacrosse data should be a public good. Today we're making that belief concrete by open-sourcing the entire platform. The data pipeline that ingests and normalizes stats, the API that serves them, and this marketing site are all available under the MIT license.

We're hoping this makes it easier for the lacrosse community to build on top of this data. Whether you're a stats-focused content creator, a coach building scouting tools, or a developer who happens to love lacrosse — the data and the infrastructure to serve it are yours to use.

- Full stack: pipeline, API, web app, marketing site
- MIT license — use it however you want
- Contributions welcome: data corrections, new league support, features
- Built with Effect-TS, TanStack, Drizzle, Cloudflare Workers
