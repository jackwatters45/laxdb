The implementation is complete. I have defined all four NLL validation interfaces as specified in the story:

1. **NLLTeam** - Interface for team validation with fields: id, code, name, nickname, displayName, team_city, team_logo, team_website_url
2. **NLLPlayer** - Interface for player validation with fields: personId, firstname, surname, fullname, dateOfBirth, height, weight, position, jerseyNumber, team_id, team_code, team_name, and optional matches object
3. **NLLStanding** - Interface for standings validation with fields: team_id, name, wins, losses, games_played, win_percentage, goals_for, goals_against, goal_diff, position
4. **NLLMatch** - Interface for match/schedule validation with fields: id, date, status, venue (nested), winningSquadId, squads (nested with away/home)

The interfaces match the extracted JSON structure that comes from the NLL schema transformations.
