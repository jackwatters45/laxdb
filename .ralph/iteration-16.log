The implementation is complete. I've:

1. ✅ Defined NLLClient as Effect.Service
2. ✅ Yielded NLLConfig in the effect 
3. ✅ Created restClient via makeRestClient with config (baseUrl and headers)
4. ✅ Set dependencies: [NLLConfig.Default]

The typecheck passes. The test failures are pre-existing issues unrelated to this change (missing env vars for PLL tests, vitest compatibility issues).
