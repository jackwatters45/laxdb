The implementation is complete. Let me summarize what was done:

1. **Added getPlayers integration tests** (`nll.integration.test.ts`):
   - Test: "fetches players for season 225" - calls `getPlayers({ seasonId: 225 })`, asserts `length > 0`, checks `personId`, `firstname`, `team_id` properties
   - Test: "returns players with expected properties" - asserts `personId` is string, `firstname` is string
   - Both tests have 30s timeout due to slower NLL API

2. **Fixed NLLPlayerRaw schema** (`nll.schema.ts`):
   - Added `{ map: {...} }` wrapper to match actual API response structure
   - Fixed field types: `personId` is Number (API), `team_id` is Number (API), `weight` is Number (API)
   - Made all fields optional with defaults since API can omit fields (like `jerseyNumber`)
   - Added `NLLPlayerMatchesRaw` schema for the simpler `{ season: number }` structure the API returns

3. **Fixed PlayersMapToArray transform**:
   - Now properly transforms `{ map: Record<...> }` to `NLLPlayer[]`
   - Converts numeric IDs to strings for the output schema
   - Maps the raw `matches.season` to the expected stats structure
