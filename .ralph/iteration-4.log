All tests pass. The implementation is complete. Let me verify there's nothing that needs adding by checking the story requirements against the actual code:

Story requirements:
1. ✅ Build validation report using buildReport - Line 266: `const report = buildReport("NLL", fileResults, crossRefs, startTime);`
2. ✅ Print report using printReport - Line 267: `yield* printReport(report);`
3. ✅ Save report to output/nll/validation-report.json - Lines 269-271:
   ```
   const reportPath = path.join(nllDir, "validation-report.json");
   yield* fs.writeFileString(reportPath, JSON.stringify(report, null, 2));
   yield* Effect.log(`Report saved to: ${reportPath}`);
   ```
4. ✅ Add BunRuntime.runMain - Line 281: `BunRuntime.runMain(program.pipe(Effect.provide(MainLayer)));`

All requirements are implemented. The validation script is complete with report generation, printing, and saving to JSON file.
