All tests pass. The story nll-manifest-005 is already complete - the `save` method was implemented as part of the previous story (nll-manifest-004) or was combined with the service creation. Looking at the code:

1. `save(manifest)` method exists ✅
2. Creates directory if not exists (`fs.makeDirectory(dir, { recursive: true })`) ✅
3. Writes manifest to JSON file (`fs.writeFileString(manifestPath, content)`) ✅
