Typecheck passes. The implementation is complete:

**Summary of changes:**
- Added `getSchedule` method to `NLLClient` in `packages/pipeline/src/nll/nll.client.ts`
- Method follows the same pattern as `getTeams`, `getPlayers`, and `getStandings`
- Imports `NLLMatch`, `NLLScheduleRequest`, and `NLLScheduleResponse` from schema
- Builds endpoint: `?data_type=schedule&season_id={seasonId}`
- Uses `NLLScheduleResponse` transform schema which flattens weekly schedule to match array
- Logs: "Fetched {n} matches for season {id}"
