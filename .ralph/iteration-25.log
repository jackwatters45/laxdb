All tests pass.

**Summary of changes:**

1. **nll.schema.ts**: Added `NLLStandingRaw` schema class and `StandingsMapToArray` transform to handle the NLL API's nested response format (`{"standings_pretty": {"": [...]}}`) and type conversions (team_id: number→string, win_percentage: string→number).

2. **nll.integration.test.ts**: Added getStandings describe block with two tests:
   - "fetches standings for season 225" - validates array has items and required properties (team_id, wins, losses)
   - "returns standings with expected properties" - validates proper types (team_id is string, wins/losses are numbers)
