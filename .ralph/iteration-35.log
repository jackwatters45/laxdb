All tests pass. The implementation is complete:

1. **`ExtractResult<T>` interface** - Holds extraction result with data, count, and timing
2. **`withTiming<T, E, R>(effect)` wrapper** - Wraps any effect to measure execution time and count results
3. **`getOutputPath(seasonId, entity)` helper** - Constructs the output path for NLL data files (`output/nll/{seasonId}/{entity}.json`)
4. **`saveJson<T>(filePath, data)` helper** - Creates directories recursively and writes JSON data to file

These helpers follow the exact same patterns as the PLL extractor and are exported from the service for use by the extraction methods that will be implemented in subsequent stories.
