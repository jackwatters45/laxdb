All four request schemas have been added:
- `NLLTeamsRequest` with `seasonId: NLLSeasonId`
- `NLLPlayersRequest` with `seasonId: NLLSeasonId`
- `NLLStandingsRequest` with `seasonId: NLLSeasonId`
- `NLLScheduleRequest` with `seasonId: NLLSeasonId`

The implementation follows the existing PLL patterns and typecheck passes.
