Implementation complete. The `getPlayers` method has been added following the exact same pattern as `getTeams`:
1. Takes `input: typeof NLLPlayersRequest.Encoded` parameter
2. Decodes input via `Schema.decode` with `mapParseError`
3. Builds endpoint: `?data_type=players&season_id={seasonId}`
4. Calls `restClient.get` with `NLLPlayersResponse` schema
5. Adds `Effect.tap` logging: "Fetched {n} players for season {id}"
